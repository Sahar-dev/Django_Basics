What is Django?
---------------

**Django** is a powerful, high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development, allowing you to focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Django follows the **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architectural pattern, which helps in organizing your code efficiently.

* * * * *

Project Overview
----------------

The **Subscription App** is a simple web application that allows users to subscribe to different plans or services. Through this project, you'll learn how to:

-   Set up a Django project and application.
-   Create and manage database models.
-   Handle user registration and authentication.
-   Develop views to handle user requests.
-   Design templates for the user interface.
-   Map URLs to corresponding views.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a functional Django application that demonstrates the core features of the framework.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

-   **Python 3.6+**: Django is a Python framework, so you'll need Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
-   **pip**: Python's package manager, usually installed with Python.
-   **Virtual Environment Tool**: It's recommended to use virtual environments to manage project dependencies. You can use `venv`, which comes with Python.

### Installation

1.  **Install Python**

    Make sure Python is installed by running:


    `python --version`

    If not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

    Create a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated.

    `python -m venv myenv`

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    -   **On Windows:**

        `myenv\Scripts\activate`

    -   **On macOS/Linux:**


        `source myenv/bin/activate`

4.  **Install Django**

    With the virtual environment activated, install Django using pip:


    `pip install django`

5.  **Verify Installation**

    Check the Django version to confirm installation:

    `django-admin --version`

Understanding Django Basics
---------------------------

Before diving into building the app, let's familiarize ourselves with some fundamental Django concepts.

### Projects and Apps

-   **Project**: A Django project is a collection of settings and configurations for a specific website. It can contain multiple apps.
-   **App**: An app is a web application that does something, e.g., a blog system, a subscription service, etc. Projects can have multiple apps working together.

### Models

Models define the structure of your database. Each model corresponds to a table in the database, and each attribute of the model represents a field in the table.

### Views

Views handle the logic of your application. They process user requests, interact with models, and return responses (usually rendering templates).

### Templates

Templates define how the data is presented to the user. They are HTML files with placeholders for dynamic content.

### URLs

URL configurations map URLs to their corresponding views. This determines what code runs when a user visits a particular URL.

Building the Subscription App
-----------------------------

Let's walk through building the Subscription App step-by-step.

### Setting Up the Project

1.  **Create a Django Project**

    Start by creating a new Django project named `subscription_project`:

    ```
    django-admin startproject subscription_project
    cd subscription_project
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server**

    Verify everything is set up correctly by running the server:


    `python manage.py runserver`

    Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You should see the Django welcome page.

### Creating the Subscription App

1.  **Start a New App**

    Create an app named `subscriptions`:

    `python manage.py startapp subscriptions`

2.  **Register the App**

    Add `'subscriptions'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `subscription_project/settings.py`:

    `INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'subscriptions',
    ]`

### Defining the Subscription Model

1.  **Create the Model**

    Open `subscriptions/models.py` and define a `SubscriptionPlan` model:
```

    from django.db import models

    class SubscriptionPlan(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
        description = models.TextField()

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name
```

2.  **Apply Migrations**

    Create and apply database migrations to reflect the new model:

```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
```

### Creating Views and Templates

1.  **Create a View**

    Open `subscriptions/views.py` and add a view to list subscription plans:

    python

    Copier le code

    `from django.shortcuts import render
    from .models import SubscriptionPlan

    def subscription_list(request):
        plans = SubscriptionPlan.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'subscriptions/subscription_list.html', {'plans': plans})`

2.  **Set Up URLs**

    Create a `urls.py` file inside the `subscriptions` app directory and map the view:

    python

    Copier le code

    `from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.subscription_list, name='subscription_list'),
    ]`

    Include the `subscriptions` URLs in the project's `urls.py` (`subscription_project/urls.py`):

    python

    Copier le code

    `from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('subscriptions/', include('subscriptions.urls')),
    ]`

3.  **Create a Template**

    Create a directory named `templates/subscriptions/` inside the `subscriptions` app and add `subscription_list.html`:

    html

    Copier le code

    `<!-- subscriptions/templates/subscriptions/subscription_list.html -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Subscription Plans</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Available Subscription Plans</h1>
        <ul>
            {% for plan in plans %}
                <li>
                    <strong>{{ plan.name }}</strong>: ${{ plan.price }}<br>
                    {{ plan.description }}
                </li>
            {% empty %}
                <li>No subscription plans available.</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </body>
    </html>`

### User Registration and Authentication

To allow users to register and manage their subscriptions, set up user authentication.

1.  **Use Django's Built-in Authentication**

    Django provides built-in views for login, logout, and password management. To set them up:

    -   Include authentication URLs in your project's `urls.py`:

        python

        Copier le code

        `urlpatterns = [
            # ...
            path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
            path('subscriptions/', include('subscriptions.urls')),
        ]`

    -   Create templates for login and logout by creating a `templates/registration/` directory.

2.  **Create a Superuser**

    To access the Django admin panel and manage subscription plans:

    `python manage.py createsuperuser`

    Follow the prompts to set up a superuser account.

* * * * *

Running the Application
-----------------------

With everything set up, you can now run and interact with your Subscription App.

1.  **Start the Development Server**

    bash

    Copier le code

    `python manage.py runserver`

2.  **Access the Application**

    -   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/subscriptions/` to see the list of subscription plans.
    -   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to access the admin panel and add subscription plans.
3.  **User Registration**

    -   Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/signup/` (you may need to create a signup view if not already set up) to create a new user account.
    -   Log in with your credentials to access subscription management features.
